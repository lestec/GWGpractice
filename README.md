# GWGpractice
GWG practice repo to get experience with GIthub
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
Hi everyone from GWG. Your first mission is to find the README.md file and enter your information into the README.md file.
Please answer the following questions:
<ul>
  <li>name</li>
  <li>discussion forum username</li>
  <li>slack username</li>
 </ul> 
Next need to make a Pull Request: Why?
  One of the key points of the feature branch workflow is that the developer who wrote the code does not merge the code with master until there has been a peer review. Leveraging Github's pull request features, once you have completed the feature branch and pushed it to the repo, there will be an option to review the diff and create a pull request.
  With all of that being said lets make some changes below. Have fun and good luck!
